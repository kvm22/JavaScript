/*
In JavaScript, the instanceof operator is used to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor function. It returns true if the object is an instance of the specified class, and false otherwise.

Here's a simple example:
 */

class Animal {
    // ... Animal class definition ...
  }
  
  class Dog extends Animal {
    // ... Dog class definition ...
  }
  
  const myDog = new Dog();
  
  console.log(myDog instanceof Dog);    // Output: true
  console.log(myDog instanceof Animal); // Output: true
  console.log(myDog instanceof Object); // Output: true (all objects are instances of Object)
  console.log(myDog instanceof String); // Output: false

  
  /*In this example, myDog is an instance of the Dog class, and it is also considered an instance of the Animal class because Dog extends Animal. It's important to note that instanceof checks the prototype chain, so if an object inherits from another object, it will return true for both.

Keep in mind that the instanceof operator may not work as expected with primitive types such as strings, numbers, and booleans, as they don't have a constructor in the same way objects do. For those cases, you might want to use other methods like typeof.
